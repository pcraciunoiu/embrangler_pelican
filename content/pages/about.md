Slug: about

I'm an independent consultant. I run [Uplift Agency](https://www.uplift.agency). Building on the internet has been my passion since 2006. See __[my resume](/cv)__ for tech details about me.

I am a big believer in creating your own path. And I know how hard it is to break free from what we are taught is possible as kids. The first step is to take responsibility. Then take action.

I work from anywhere. I love what I do. My work has a big impact. People trust me and enable me to do my best. And this is just the beginning.
