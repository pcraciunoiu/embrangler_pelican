Slug: about

From 2012 onwards I've been working at startups, and I'm now transitioning to a part time job in order to focus on developing other skills, personal and professional. [Read more about that here.](/pitch)

In 2011, I founded my own company, SoWink Inc. The company has been discontinued in January 2012. During this time, I managed a team of engineers, built a dating product with too many features and learned a ton about software, the web, and the sheer diversity of knowledge a founder must have.

Until April 2011, I worked as a full time web developer for Mozilla, with main focus on [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), Python, and PHP. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of California at Santa Cruz. I've been involved with Mozilla since June 2008.

Web development has been my passion since 2006, and I have, on occasion, worked on or volunteered for several other sites. See __[my resume](/cv)__ for tech details about me.
