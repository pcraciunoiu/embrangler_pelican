Slug: about

I'm an independent consultant. I run [Uplift Agency](http://uplift.agency).

From 2012 onwards I worked with startups. Most recently I worked with [Minerva Project](http://minervaproject.com): a university looking to revolutionize education through a unique model. Prior to this I worked with [Humble Bundle](https://humblebundle.com), a Sequoia and Y-Combinator backed company, profitable since before it started. In both places I went much beyond engineer responsibilities.

In 2011, I founded my own company, SoWink Inc. The company has been discontinued in January 2012. During this time, I managed a team of engineers, built a dating product with too many features and learned a ton about software, the web, and the sheer diversity of knowledge a founder must have.

Until April 2011, I worked as a full time web developer for Mozilla, with main focus on [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), Python, and PHP. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of California at Santa Cruz. I've been involved with Mozilla since June 2008.

Web development has been my passion since 2006, and I have, on occasion, worked on or volunteered for several other sites. See __[my resume](/cv)__ for tech details about me.
