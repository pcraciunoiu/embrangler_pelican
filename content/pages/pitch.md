## Quick bio

* Seasoned programmer in mid 20s with 12+ years of experience (see [programming life](#programming-life))
	* Majority of experience in web development
	* Native mobile development (Android)
* Believes getting work done >> using the newest, coolest technologies (see [my view on technology](#view-on-technology))
	* Interested in "hot" new technologies
	* Ability to learn quickly
* [Can deliver on tight deadlines](#i-can-efficiently-deliver-on-tight-deadlines)
* [Experienced with cross-team projects](#i-can-efficiently-deliver-on-tight-deadlines)
* Risk-tolerant (see [hobbies](#hobbies) and [values](#values))
* [Excited, passionate, ambitious and motivated](#excited-passionate-ambitions-and-motivated)
* [Flexible interests](#domains-of-interest)
* Great communicator
* Confident and honest

## What I'm looking for

* opportunity to be extremely productive
* flexible hours
* challenging, fun work
* predominantly remote, and ideally part time ([why?](#why-part-time-andor-remote))
* opportunity for growth (see [growth interests](#growth-interests))

### Why part time and/or remote?

I love to travel and work from various timezones. Letting someone work flexible, remote hours may seem like __a big sacrifice__ for a company. It's not as big as it seems. In return for the apparent sacrifice you get:

* a good communicator, experienced with working remotely
* a [risk taker](#values) willing to step up to a challenge
* someone who's [gone through starting a company](/2012/01/sowink-discontinued/) and managing a small team
* someone who's [done product management work and delivered on a cross-team, tight-deadline schedule](#i-can-efficiently-deliver-on-tight-deadlines)
* a productive, efficient programmer

And I can do this all with excitement, motivation and ambition.

## Programming life

I've been excited about, and doing __programming since I was 14__.

I sort of grew up breathing bits. My dad got me and my brother our first computer before I was in elementary. I'd been toying around with computers until high school, when I took advanced courses in data structures, algorithms, etc. My first programming language was [Pascal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29).

In high school, I participated in local and national programming competitions and olympiads.

I got into __web development in college__ and immediately got paid for it. Through college and beyond I:

* worked for Mozilla (mostly their support site), learning from many experienced folks
* started my own company (which lasted about a year)
* worked for startups (namely Humble Bundle and Minerva Project)

These are just some of the technologies I'm familiar with. Don't worry, I learn new ones quickly and frequently.

* Python
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Backbone and Marionette
* Grunt
* PHP
* Java (including native Android development)
* Clojure
* C/C++
* SASS and LESS
* CSS3 and HTML5
* Google drive/docs scripting
* Ruby on rails (although haven't worked with it for years)
* Bash scripting and UNIX terminal
* nginx and apache
* git, subversion, CVS, mercurial (hg)
* ... and more

## View on technology

I firmly believe technology provides us with a set of tools to make people's lives easier and better. In the larger scope of things, business and human needs drive technology forward.

As such, I am first excited about producing something to make your life better. Second, about working in a happy, challenging team. And last (but not least?) about beautiful code. This is not to say I disagree with the value of well-written software, but merely that I come at it from a pragmatic point of view.

In terms of _new technologies_, any future-invested, future-oriented company must strike a balance. Depending on the business, technical challenges and timeline, it may or may not be wise to invest a large percentage of your engineering budget towards it. However, once you have a viable business model that looks like it could be sustainable, thinking ahead becomes necessary. New technologies may provide cheaper business operation and a more nimble engineering team (for example, by increasing productivity and thus reducing the size of a team or increasing its throughput).

Check out [some technologies I'm excited about](#growth-interests).

## Growth interests

I am __always__ interested in growth, both personally and professionally. It's one of the reasons I seek out challenges. These are just some areas:

* Product Management
	* Requirements
	* Prioritizing
	* Organizing
	* Leading meetings
	* Moving things forward
	* Getting out of the way or doing it, when the grunt of the work needs to get done
* Technologies
	* Node.js
	* Angular (and Meteor)
	* Mobile web & native
	* Ruby on rails
	* High concurrency (erlang, clojure, java)
	* Possibly, [Go (programming language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29)
* Engineering management and leadership<sup>1)</sup>
	* Interpersonal skills may be the largest contributor to employee happiness, and thus productivity and loyalty
	* Facilitating efficient technical work
	* Motivating my team and empowering them to grow
	* Taking on high-level stress while maintaing as much transparency as makes sense for team and business
	* Ensuring team growth and career trajectory

<sup>1)</sup> The engineering team at my former startup called me __the best manager they've ever had__. I was only 23. I believe this claim is largely supported by my philosophy towards work, people and engineering. I care about employee happiness. I'm as genuine at work as I am in my personal life. My team trusted me and felt supported to grow. They were optimistic about our company's future (even in our toughest moments) while being aware that we have big challenges ahead. Through code review, feature planning, and pair programming, I ensured my team learned and worked as one cohesive unit.

I can work with you to help create and maintain an environment where technical folk feel challenged, motivated, and empowered.

### I can efficiently deliver on tight deadlines

While at Minerva Project, I stepped up as the first engineer to take on a new project: building an Admissions website for our future students (read: users, and __main source of revenue__ for our business' future).

This proved to be a heavily cross-team, tight-deadline project with an initial lack of direction and responsibility from upper management. Over time, my responsibilities included:

* Meeting demands from various teams
	* operations: for triaging, evaluating, and ranking students for admission
	* legal: student data storage, privacy and security (one- and two-way encryption, storing data securely, managing permissions, etc), including updates and internal tracking for versions of admissions policy, terms of service and privacy policy
	* marketing: for increasing the top of the funnel and throughput on the first step of the application process
	* academics: for content, fairness, correctness, and algorithms involved in our process, including our ranking tools and admissions formula (which I conveniently termed "the bar")
	* and engineering: sometimes delivering as a solo engineer, sometimes with help (be it part-time from Minerva's engineering team, or with external contractors)
* Building a never-before-seen, modern, speedy application process
* Building internal tools to aid our academics team in ranking and filtering our applicants
	* Meetings to discuss process and fairness
	* Created efficient, easy to use, future-scalable tools with fast turnaround (occassionaly on the order of days, even hours)
* Operational on a global scale
	* Enabling applicants from China to view and submit applications
	* Optimizing load times for locations around the world
* Sharpening my product management skills
	* Working closely with head of Admissions Operations
	* Gathering and writing requirements
	* Sketching product roadmap and quarterly goals
	* Creating wireframes for review by our lead UX designer
	* Leading meetings with actionable goals
	* Putting together the basics for a CMS switch to enable marketing and academics teams to edit without being blocked by engineering
	* Etc.
* Serving as technical support for both our users and our internal team
	* Continuously improving our internal and external forms
	* At a startup, it's hard to overstate the importance of being close to your users

### Have worked as a solo engineer or in a team

* Created reusable projects on my own
	* Forked and completely revamed [AppEngine Admin](https://github.com/pcraciunoiu/appengine_admin), an admin interface for AppEngine.
	* Wrote and maintained integrating tools around django and Amazon Web Services ([django-ses](https://github.com/hmarr/django-ses), [django-s3-sync](https://github.com/pcraciunoiu/django-s3sync)).
* Managed a team of 5
	* At my startup, integrated people of diverse backgrounds and expertise into one cohesive unit.
	* In my (obviously biased) opinion, our code quality and processes were some of the most efficient out there. I've yet to work at a job that matched this environment.
* Worked with external contractors
	* This is where priorities, consistency and quality of work tends to suffer the most.
	* Learned to evaluate, onboard and delegate with a dynamically changing team, made up of one part-time UX contractor, one part-time in-house engineer, and two part-time external engineering contractors (and changing at various points in time).

### Extensive experience with non-engineering folks

As [mentioned above](#i-can-efficiently-deliver-on-tight-deadlines), I worked with non-technical folks for extensive periods of time at Minerva Project. 

Additionally, while running my own company, I worked directly with users, business and marketing. I also did significant work in these areas myself, so I can understand the reasons for a company's actions more than your average engineer.

### Open source experience

I worked at Mozilla as my first, full-time web developer position. Needless to say, open source is part of my blood. This resulted in [a less common view and set of values](#excited-passionate-ambitions-and-motivated) than most engineers. See [my github](https://github.com/pcraciunoiu) for some examples here.

While at my startup, I created and [maintained](https://github.com/hmarr/django-ses) [a few](/2012/01/serve-media-from-amazon-s3-and-keep-it-in-sync/) [projects](/2012/01/caching-django-views-with-nginx-and-memcache/) that filled people's needs and taught me to think reusably.

At Humble Bundle, I was the main employee pushing for modularizing and [open sourcing our work](http://blog.humblebundle.com/post/30886969195/our-lovely-app-engine-paginator).

### Remote work experience

* Mozilla
	* A heavily remote-driven work environment
	* Offices in various places around the world
	* Many employees work from various timezones in the same team, from home, or traveling
	* Get togethers in person during off-sites or company-wide/team-wide conferences
	* Half of my team was in different timezones around the US
	* For a month, I worked from Romania, which is a 9-10 hour time difference from California
* Personal/side-projects
	* Continuously working with my brother on remote projects and ideas

As a result of above, I:

* Learned to communicate effectively and get work done without blocking others from doing theirs, or being blocked
* At various times at Mozilla I was the most prolifix bug-fixer in our team, cranking out and polishing, taking on the "most unpleasant" work (which I enjoyed)
* Am exteremely comfortable getting work done and staying in the loop in a remote-friendly culture, without too much overhead.

### Excited, passionate, ambitious and motivated

Anyone who knows me well can testify that I am a positive, energetic, driven individual, both in my work and personal life.

* Courage is the only path to a rewarding life. Living in fear is not.
* I am excited to take chances and learn.
* I strive to always maintain a sense of progress, which keeps me motivated.
* My grandma raised me to be ambitious, but also grateful for the small things in life.
* If I'm not passionate about what I do, I find a way to reinterpret how I see it, or change what I do. I do not wallow around delivering subpar work just to disappoint myself and those who count on me.

## Values 

In addition to the above, I value:

* Integrity and honesty, because inner conflict and lies eat away at oneself and the organization.
* Openness and transparency, because when we hide things, we usually do so out of fear. Do we really want to build a company driven by fear, as if people were animals?
* Directness in communication, because clear communication is key to successful teamwork.
* Compassion and kindness, because we all have rough days. We live in an "us" world, not an "us VS they" one.
* Doing the best quality work that I can do (this may be the single, largest reason I would stay with or leave a company).
* Taking chances, because without risk there can be no reward. The only risk-free paths have already been well traveled.

## Hobbies

I highly value physical and mental fitness, as well as increased focus and overcoming limiting beliefs by expanding my comfort zone. This brings my mind and body closer together.
 
Current top ways I like to spend my time:

* Meditation
* Traveling (especially to warm destinations)
* Kitesurfing, kiteboarding, surfing
* Rock climbing
* Yoga
* Snowboarding and snowkiting
* Biking, especially steep hills
* Dancing (mostly salsa, bachata and swing)
* Personal development

Few things in life can compare to achieving something one previously thought was impossible. I believe in living courageously and pushing my boundaries.

## Domains of interest

Anything really, if it's a great opportunity or learning experience. Something to get you started:

* Health care
* Education
* Nonprofit
* Businesses with a revenue model not driven by advertisement
