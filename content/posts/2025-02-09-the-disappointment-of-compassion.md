Summary: Self compassion is the best (worst?)

Compassion is disappointing because it's so simple. It boils down to just being present. What? That's it? Yes! You be present, to make space, to feel your feelings, to accept that it's okay the way it is. Feel love and understanding for all as it is. It's just letting the heart be open, non-judgmental, not necessarily forgiving but understanding, sitting with it.

As I was working through some challenges, it seemed like the answer to every self-stress, self-judgment, self-aggression, is just compassion. And then practicing it is just about making room feel your s---? Just sitting with it?

Boring. Disappointing. Also... beautifully simple.
