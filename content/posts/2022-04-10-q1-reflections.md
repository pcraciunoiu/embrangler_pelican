Summary: Reflections on first quarter of 2022, with a look at yearly resolutions.

I'm writing these from the Dominican Republic, so I'm extra happy and relaxed. Very grateful to be here, and it feels like the post-pandemic world. Still feel like I'm thriving. I give myself permission to keep these reflections a bit brief, a) because I want to make the most of being here, and b) it's only the first quarter of the year, there's more to come!

This quarter has brought life changes - getting married, meeting my partner's nephew - my nephew now, too.

# Revisit resolutions

Here were my topics for the year:

1. [Physical: Move With Ease](#physical-move-with-ease)
1. [Emotional: Embrace What Is](#emotional-embrace-what-is)
1. [Mental: Part of a Whole](#mental-part-of-a-whole)
1. [Spiritual: Wholehearted Collaboration](#spiritual-wholehearted-collaboration)

## Physical: Move With Ease

Working with a trainer has been amazing, have definitely gained muscle and also strength. Switching to strength gaining is more rewarding than I expected - I finally got to a good point with my weight/muscle/look, and although I could tone up a bit more, I'm also very excited to feel strong. And it feels good to get some cardio during the workout, and regular swims.

Celebrations:

* Working with trainer.
* Strength gains.
* Swimming 1x/week, quite exhausting - I could take a nap after!
* Tracking wellness budget
* Parasite cleanse
* GF/DF pretty consistently, rare exceptions
* Dilligent about dry eyes - eye drops, diffuser. No humidifier yet, but may upgrade the home someday
* Headaches down significantly

Improvement:

* Continue GF
* kettlebell, more trampoline
* bloat and gas sometimes
* grounding outside, not much
* stretch more
* still a couple of headaches - maybe <4 all quarter though!

## Emotional: Embrace What Is

I've definitely detached my self worth from work more, but not enough. I still worry about it a lot, and push myself to finish stuff I'm working on. I do see improvement as far as judging myself though, I treat myself better than I used to.

Celebrations:

* Walking into the office I feel less stress, the post-it note does work to bring my mind to feel relaxed and spacious
* I put myself in clients' and team members' shoes more frequently and it helps me relax, listen and empathize more easily.
* I've been taking notes on my anger and frustration, and that has helped reduce it or bring awareness to what's causing it
* Releasing through gym and kitesurfing
* Working on the business mission and values, marketing, etc
* Shared joy at work
* Gave focus presentation at a business group and felt good to get feedback

Room for improvement:

* I still have a hard time stepping away without finishing all that I feel is "on the list" or in progress. After traveling, this has been the most common cause of headaches.
* Related, I feel constrained by my daily schedule - still feels busy at times.
* I still have a hard time doing nothing. Though it has gotten easier (could be listed above)
* Could encourage and empower our team more

Really happy with my emotional well being. I like my intention, though the affirmation isn't really tied to it.

## Mental: Part of a Whole

Celebrations:

* I am taking more breaks at work, doing stretches, little things.
* Taking deep breaths while I'm at the desk
* Using my strengths for sure, coordinating our team, onboarding, offboarding, check-ins, sharing feedback, thinking ahead on projects. Did some creative work or content as well - mission and values.
* Hired 1 employee, wohoo!

Room for improvement:

* There are still days when I sit down for too long trying to finish something.
* Take those 5m breaks every hour. I do take them at least every other hourâ€¦ but it can be rough if I skip more than one a day.
* Kicking off other breaks - need more easy ways to do it.
* Brainstorm more of what I'm good at and do more of that. Reduce what I'm doing that is not in this area.

My favorite is definitely the deep breathing. It's not the most consistent habit, in that, I'd love to take a deep breath with every sip of liquid, but it does help do it more often and I catch myself holding my breath more.

## Spiritual: Wholehearted Collaboration

Technically I did this in April, but I'm very excited to have booked a silent meditation retreat and will talk about it next quarter for sure.

Room for improvement

* Not doing evening meditations or inversions regularly. Would really like to tend to my neck and back with those.
* Walking meditation too, after work
* Busywork - happens more rarely that I jump around, but it does.

Celebrations:

* Reached 600 consecutive days of meditation!
* Enjoying where I live more. Especially with gardening. And, by traveling elsewhere too, I appreciate when I come back home.
* Investing in the home - fixing up the fence, in progress.
* I often think about compounding, big picture, and helping direct our team to work well on their own, with kindness. I enjoy leadership.
* Passing feedback to help improve a team members' work has me worried at times, and it's helpful to remember people want to do well, and they want to improve.



# Present and future

To frame in a more mindful way (inspired by Headspace meditations): How are you now? How do you want to be feeling and living?

You feel joy and lightness. Getting back to the gym, traveling, socializing, eating with the seasons. So many good experiences in Q3! You feel very connected to nature. One remarkable benefit since returning from Europe has been getting up early - at the crack of dawn really.

It's harder to write in the second person I'm noticing - so will switch for now.

Q4 is a wrap up of the year. It's time to slow down and live even more spaciously than before. It's not about stopping altogether, more about steady, slow flow. Look forward to the CSA for the 2nd year in a row. Also will be rounding out the first full year in a new house. A couple of trips. Family time. Vacation. Smooth transitions. Guiding the way with patience, nurture. I'm really content with where I'm at and contentfully looking to the next 3 months, as well.

With Uplift, funny I was looking forward to more sales and marketing. I ended up de-prioritizing marketing altogether, since we are getting plenty of referrals through our network. Focus was a lot more on HR, project management, and sales.

During trip to Europe/vacation I got the chance to reflect more on who I am. I'm a nourishing leader and a guide. I have incredible focus, and steadiness. I'm finding more and more balance and contentment in sustained growth (versus do-it-fast and worry about it later).
