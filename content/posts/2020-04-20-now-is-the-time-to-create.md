Summary: TODO

I have this boost of creativity. As it is with creativity, I'm not always sure where this is headed.

But bear with me.

I feel inspired to build a business 10x bigger than the sum of it parts. To assemble and align a team of talented, dedicated builders. Of software (for now).

I've been thinking a lot about intuition this year, and how it plays into the reasons we do... well, everything. We prize our rational mind for its amazing accomplishments, we tout the greatness of our brains and how quickly--in evolutionary terms--they have grown in size. And we all too often forget what really drives decisions.

Feelings, and beyond those feelings: our guts.

This is why I invest in my gut this year. Yes, this includes hella scary decisions and stepping out of my comfort zone--sometimes feeling a little far from my norm. This is entrepreneur mode.

I recently got a business coach and our first session is still shaping my business. I chose this coach from my gut. Did I do any research? Well, yeah. I considered others. And when I had to narrow it down, at the end of the day what mattered the most is that I had a good feeling about it. Maybe it just happened to fall in my lap, or maybe I had been open to the opportunity, and seized it when it presented itself.

Now that's intuition. I've been practicing seizing opportunities as they emerge.
