Summary: My personal reflections for Q3. Anything expressed is my own.

I took some time to reflect on what life brings me for Q3. Questions I started with:

1. What has given me the most joy and vitality?
2. What has worried me the most?
3. How can I get my life more in alignment with my values?

Using Brene Brown's [List of 100 values](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Values.pdf), what are my top 5? And preferrably, narrow it to two.

Here's my first pass at narrowing down:

* Accountability
* Balance
* Curiosity
* Growth
* Health
* Initiative
* Integrity
* Joy
* Justice
* Knowledge
* Learning
* Openness
* Optimism
* Perseverance
* Reliability
* Resourcefulness
* Risk-taking
* Self-discipline
* Service
* Spirituality
* Wealth
* Well-being
* Wholeheartedness

Another pass, down to 10:

* Balance
* Curiosity
* Health
* Integrity
* Joy
* Learning
* Openness
* Perseverance
* Wealth
* Wholeheartedness

Another pass, down to 5:

* Curiosity
* Health
* Joy
* Learning
* Wealth
