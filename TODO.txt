Bugs:
* related posts deduping (some articles show the same related post repeatedly)
* look into the multiple author pages for paul-craciunoiu*

Enhancements:
* use publishconf.py or delete it
* add hooks.php to git and store password elsewhere
* auto-update upon commit
* get rid of the output warning for same title posts
* fixed sidebar layout, including contact info, the list and resume, and feeds link (/feeds/all.atom.xml)
* look into using LaTex and convert _old_posts to the new format.
